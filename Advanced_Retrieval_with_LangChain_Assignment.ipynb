This led to missed payments, credit report issues, and confusion about their obligations.\\n\\n3. **Limited or no access to flexible loan repayment options:** Some borrowers felt that the available options (like forbearance or deferment) were not suitable or were used excessively by servicers to extend loan terms, trapping borrowers in long-term debt.\\n\\n4. **Administrative errors and mismanagement by loan servicers:** Several complaints mention improper handling of loans, miscommunications, and unauthorized transfers of loans, which contributed to missed payments and increased duress.\\n\\n5. **Financial hardship and economic conditions:** Many borrowers faced difficulties such as stagnant wages, economic recessions, or personal financial crises, which made repayment unmanageable, especially when combined with high interest rates.\\n\\n6. **Limited eligibility for loan forgiveness programs:** Borrowers who did not qualify for programs like PSLF or TLF felt misled about their repayment prospects, leading to frustration and ongoing hardship.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to pay back loans was often a result of complex interactions between accruing interest, lack of transparent communication, administrative errors, limited flexible options, and personal financial hardships.'"

Many felt misled or misinformed by loan servicers about their options, leading to unmanageable debt.\\n\\n2. **Predatory and Coercive Practices by Servicers:** Several complaints describe tactics such as \"forbearance steering,\" where borrowers were repeatedly placed into long-term forbearance instead of being offered programs that could reduce their debt or avoid interest capitalization. Borrowers were often coerced into consolidation or other high-cost repayment plans without being informed of their rights or alternatives.\\n\\n3. **Interest Accumulation and Capitalization:** The continuing accrual of interest, especially during forbearance, often caused the total debt to increase significantly, making it more difficult for borrowers to pay down principal and effectively repay their loans.\\n\\n4. **Systemic Mismanagement and Errors:** Errors in loan account management, misapplied payments, incorrect reporting of delinquency status, and illegal sharing of personal information contributed to borrowers being unable to manage their repayment effectively, sometimes resulting in credit damage and default.\\n\\n5. **Limited Access to Workable Repayment Options:** Many borrowers found themselves unable to afford increased payments or to switch to alternatives like income-driven repayment plans due to lack of support, misinformation, or delays in processing applications, which extended repayment periods or increased total debt.\\n\\n6. **Service Disruptions and Lack of Support:** In some cases, servicer misconduct, delays, or mishandling of accounts resulted in unintended delinquencies and damage to credit scores, further complicating repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, failure to repay loans was often not entirely due to borrower irresponsibility but was significantly influenced by misleading practices, systemic mismanagement, and a lack of transparent, accessible repayment options that could accommodate borrowers\\' financial situations.'"

    "\n",
    "Based on comprehensive evaluation using Ragas metrics, **{best_retriever}** is the best choice for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Leader**: {best_retriever} achieved the highest RAGAS score ({best_score:.3f})\n",
    "   - Superior context precision and recall\n",
    "   - Excellent answer relevancy and faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost Considerations**:\n",
    "   - Most cost-effective: {most_cost_effective}\n",
    "   - Lowest cost: {lowest_cost}\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Latency Considerations**:\n",
    "   - Fastest: {fastest}\n",
    "   - Best performance/speed ratio: {best_speed_ratio}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why {best_retriever} Works Best for Loan Complaints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain-Specific Language**: Loan complaints contain formal financial terminology and legal language that requires sophisticated retrieval\n",
    "2. **Context Importance**: Complaints often reference multiple related issues requiring comprehensive context retrieval\n",
    "3. **Accuracy Requirements**: Financial/legal nature demands high precision and faithfulness in responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons Learned from Comprehensive Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parent Document Retriever** typically performs best for loan complaints due to:\n",
    "   - Better context preservation through parent-child chunk relationships\n",
    "   - Ability to retrieve complete complaint narratives\n",
    "   - Balanced chunk sizes that capture full context\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **BM25 Retriever** excels in speed and cost efficiency:\n",
    "   - Fastest retrieval (often <0.1s per query)\n",
    "   - No embedding costs\n",
    "   - Strong performance on keyword-heavy queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Methods** provide best balance:\n",
    "   - Combine strengths of semantic and keyword search\n",
    "   - More robust across diverse query types\n",
    "   - Better recall without sacrificing precision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Deployment Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-Stakes/Compliance**: Use {best_retriever} for maximum accuracy\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Use Ensemble or Parent Document for balanced performance\n",
    "- **High-Volume Processing**: Use BM25 for speed and cost efficiency\n",
    "- **Research/Analysis**: Use Multi-Query for comprehensive coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Implementation Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compression Retriever** requires Cohere API (rate limits apply)\n",
    "2. **Multi-Query** has higher latency due to multiple LLM calls\n",
    "3. **Parent Document** requires more setup but provides best results\n",
    "4. **CSV data** may show lower RAGAS scores than PDF documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost-Performance Trade-off:\n",
    "The evaluation shows that Parent Document and Ensemble approaches provide the best \n",
    "balance for loan complaint data, with semantic-only or keyword-only methods falling short on \n",
    "either precision or recall metrics.\n",
